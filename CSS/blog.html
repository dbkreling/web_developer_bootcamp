      Better safe than sorry. That's my motto. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle. Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying.

      No, you're just speaking for me! Like I ain't got the goddamn sense to speak for myself! Is that it? Is that what you're doing? Heisenberg says, 'Relax'!

      What's your name? Have a seat, Heisenberg. What is this shit? This is blue. TIGHT! Tight, tight, YEAH! Oh, blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man. Just keep bringing me that. Alright. Money up front. Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches, just as long as we got an understanding.
